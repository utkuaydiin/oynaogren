      title: "Photosynthesis: From Sunlight to Sugar",
      scenario: "You're a photon of light that has just traveled 93 million miles from the sun and hit a leaf on a maple tree. Your journey is about to begin as you help transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.",
      steps: [
        "As a photon, you strike a chlorophyll molecule in a chloroplast, energizing an electron that starts the process.",
        "The energized electron moves through the electron transport chain, helping to produce ATP and NADPH.",
        "These energy carriers move to the Calvin cycle where they help convert CO2 into glucose.",
        "For each glucose molecule created, six molecules of water are split, releasing six O2 molecules as a byproduct.",
        "The glucose produced is either used immediately by the plant for energy or stored as starch for later use."
      ],
      explanation: "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. This process occurs in the chloroplasts, primarily in the leaves. The overall equation is 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2. The process has two main stages: light-dependent reactions that convert sunlight to ATP and NADPH, and the Calvin cycle that uses these products to create glucose from carbon dioxide.",

        "What would happen to the photosynthesis process if there was no sunlight available?",
